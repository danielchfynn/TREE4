glmnet() function , alpha = 1

Is a shrinkage method
contains all p predictors, but constrains or reguarizes the coefficient estimates, or pushes towards zero
uses least squares estimate shrinking rss, but also a tuning parameter lambda that penalises 
kambda = 0 gives ls estimate 

```{r}
carseats_train = read.csv("Carseats_train.csv")

carseats_train = subset(carseats_train, select = -X )


x_train=model.matrix (Price ~.,carseats_train )[,-1]
y_train=carseats_train$Price
```

standardize = FALSE will stop having variables on the same scale 
needs to be same as with ridge regression, coefficients can be affected by scaling

ridge regression flexibility decreases as lambda increases

lasso overcomes the disadvantage of ridge regression, where it cant set coefficients to zero. 
uses l1 penalty not l2
performs variable selection
