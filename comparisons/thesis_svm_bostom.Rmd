support vector machine p352 intro to stat learning
classifier 
generalisation of maximal marginal classifier - requires separation by a linear boundary 
allowing non linear class boundaries 
svm are for binary classification - can be extended for multi response 

need to choose a separating hyperplane, thus maximal margin hyperplane is used to select 1, it is farthest from the training obs
can classify with the maximal margin classifier
margin is perpindicular distance from plane to obs. 

can have overfitting with large p (p-dimensions)

will be using the extension support vector regression 

svr seeks coefficients that minimise a different ttype of loss (not mse), nly using abs(predictors) creater than some value 

can use the e1071 library 

or liblineaR for bigger prolems


svm() can be used to fit a regression problem, but passing a numerical response instead of factor


```{r}

library(MASS)


set.seed(10)
index = seq(1,506)
vals = sample(index, 340)


Boston$chas = as.factor(Boston$chas)
Boston$rad = as.factor(Boston$rad)

boston_train = Boston[vals,]
boston_test = Boston[-vals,]

```



svr uses ols
mu svr - determiens proportion of support vectors
esp svr - determines the cost 
gamma = 1/ data_dim (12)
epsilon - insenstive loss fn - the area around the the svm before the cost fn is iniated. 

```{r}
library (e1071)
svmfit =svm(medv~., data=boston_train , kernel ="linear", cost =10, scale =TRUE )
summary (svmfit )

#plot(svmfit,carseats_train)
```



cost - cost for a violation to the margin
scale = FALSE to not scale features to have mean zeo / sd = 1



tune performs 10-fold cv
looks at wide range of cost param

```{r}
set.seed (1)
tune.out=tune(svm ,medv~., data=boston_train, scale =TRUE,kernel ="linear", ranges =list(cost=c(0.001 , 0.01, 0.1, 1,5,10,100) ))

summary (tune.out)
```


```{r}
bestmod =tune.out$best.model
summary (bestmod )
```


```{r}
plot(bestmod$residuals)
abline(lm(bestmod$residuals ~ seq(from = 0, to = 340, length.out = 340)))

```


looks like white noise



 prediction

 
```{r}
ypred=predict (bestmod ,boston_test )
mean((boston_test$medv - ypred)^2)

```






```{r}

formula_svm = as.formula(paste("Price ~ ."))


model = e1071::svm(formula_svm, data=carseats_train , kernel ="linear", cost =10, scale =TRUE)


model
```



will repeat on the predictors subset form best subset


```{r}
svmfit =svm(Price~ CompPrice+ Sales+ Income+Advertising + ShelveLoc + Age, data=carseats_train , kernel ="linear", cost =10, scale =TRUE )
summary (svmfit )


set.seed (1)
tune.out=tune(svm ,Price~ CompPrice+ Sales+ Income+Advertising + ShelveLoc + Age, data=carseats_train, scale =TRUE,kernel ="linear", ranges =list(cost=c(0.001 , 0.01, 0.1, 1,5,10,100) ))

summary (tune.out)


bestmod =tune.out$best.model
summary (bestmod )

plot(bestmod$residuals)
abline(lm(bestmod$residuals ~ seq(from = 0, to = 280, length.out = 280)))

ypred=predict (bestmod ,carseats_test )
mean((carseats_test$Price - ypred)^2)

```


again a better performance using the subset from best subset




Using caret

```{r}
library(caret)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
train_control = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5)
set.seed(50)
model = train(Price~., data = carseats_train, method = "svmLinear", trControl = train_control,tuneGrid = expand.grid(C =c(0.001 , 0.01, 0.1, 1,5,10,100)))
print(model)



```


```{r}
pred_y = predict(model, carseats_test)

mean((carseats_test$Price - pred_y)^2)

#caret::RMSE(carseats_test$Price, pred_y)

```



```{r}
set.seed(50)
model = train(Price~ CompPrice+ Sales+ Income+Advertising + ShelveLoc + Age, data = carseats_train, method = "svmLinear", trControl = train_control,tuneGrid = expand.grid(C =c(0.001 , 0.01, 0.1, 1,5,10,100)))
print(model)


pred_y = predict(model, carseats_test)

mean((carseats_test$Price - pred_y)^2)

#caret::RMSE(carseats_test$Price, pred_y)

```

 slightly better better mse
