Cart – includes cart.method = “LATENT-BUDGET-TREE” 

The creates a tree using latent budgets, utilising the rpy2 library and lba function in R. 
Assessing returned alpha values greater than 0.5 and assigning the corresponding class to the left split. 

Please note for the creation of the class element, an impurity function is still passed, 
such as gini, and is used during display only. 

Also latent budget tree is only available for classifier problems

This takes the max_k (complete) top tau predictors to assess. Complete as in no error is returned from 
the lba function: such as inversing non square matricies. This max_k parameter can be passed to the cart.growing_tree() function.

I am confident in the tau calculations comparing with R GKtau library. 

Also the cart.print_tree() function has been updated to include the percentages of all the classes in the nodes, 
to see how it goes. The cart.print_tree() also takes hyperparameter table = True to return a pandas dataframe of 
the information about the tree. This includes the alpha and beta parameters from the split but is a bit messy. 

Please note this table is only available for latent budget tree at this time. 

Also the print_tree() function takes html as a parameter that will open the graph in your browser and create a html
 object in your directory. This was because in jupyter the graphs could be a bit small and hard to distinguish, 
especially with increasing depth. 

A quite weird thing, is as it is a classifier problem all observations are strings / objects for the predictors 
and that if using pandas, for importing the data frame both training and test tests will need to have index’s starting at 0

I have included my play dataset, which is Christians, and is the transport dataset and is attached.

combination_split
included combination_split paramater in growing_tree - which will only work for lbt 

This simple combines the groups for the top two tau. - and also works with max_k, so will iterate towards the the 2nd and 3rd highest ect. 

FOr example distance and car_ownership make a new group distance*car_ownership
where the classes (strings) are concatenated such as 
car_ownership0 (a class in car ownershuip) + distance02
would become car_onership0distance02.

The prints are very busy, when there are a combination of many classes 

I add the best split found from this to the list in cart, n_features, which can be accessed after class creation, for inspectoin. 


Performed fixed for the node proportion total and gain, to make correct use of delta (the change in done deviance explained) as before it was cheated a bit. 

At the moment, for regression it is calculated with sum {i node in leaves} (n|i* mean(y|i) -mean(y)**2)
where n|i is the number in the ith node, and y|i are the y values in the ith node

And for classification is the sum of the entropy in the leaves 

Printing trees with table is available for all methods 



Twoing
Started to apply twoing algorithm
Create eevry combination of the response variable 
Reassign the y value for that 
####AM using gini / entropy as the splitting choice metric for lbt instead of outputed ls
also am using the actual gini/entropy in the results table for the j classes, not the c1,c2, classes
Notice when running lbt using k = 1 is ok, as there are many errors from lba function when running this
Min imp gain set at 1e-6, max level = 4, min class parent 1000, min class child 500 
Also implemented table visuals 

ALso implemented table visuals for use with cart, fast and twostage, all are considerably slower than lba.


Twoing Regression
Taking the set of each value in the y values in the node (starting with root)
iterate through each value in the set, and calculate the between variance of the groups, 
c1 is for each value < the max between variance, c2 otherwise
change the cart setting into classifier settings with appropiate impur_fn
send this all to the node_search_split and apply required method either cart, fast, two-stage /lbt 
	have only ran fast so far 
	also works cart
	also for lbt
iterate this process

created image to show how the code works for twoing for both class and reg



attempts made with visual pruning but not fruitful. Attempting first to have the same lebgths, but continually had crossing branches. May have to implement a plotting algorithm for this. 

we can use node prop gains for the length of the branches (in some way)
